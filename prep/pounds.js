const price = 1135.60; // Just an example value. Try changing this value to 0, 10, or 1521, and make sure you still get the right answer from your code.

const pounds = price/100; // Your code here - calculate the price in pounds and store it in this variable. Make sure to round to 2 decimal places, as we are used to seeing prices in pounds with 2 decimal places.

console.log(`The price is ${pounds.toFixed(2)} pounds`); // Just an example value. Try changing this value to 0, 10, or 1521, and make sure you still get the right answer from your code.
