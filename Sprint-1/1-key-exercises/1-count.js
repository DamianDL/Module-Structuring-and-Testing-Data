let count = 0;

count = count + 1;
console.log(count); // Output: 1
// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Line 3 is an assignment statement that updates the value of the count variable. The expression on the right-hand side (count + 1) calculates the new value by taking the current value of count (which is 0) and adding 1 to it, resulting in 1. The = operator then assigns this new value back to the count variable, effectively updating it from 0 to 1.
